# Release Notes

## 2.0.0 - August 23, 2011

### Enter and Update

The **enter-update** pattern has been simplified: the [enter](Selections#wiki-wiki-enter) selection now merges into the [update](Selections#wiki-wiki-data) selection when you append or insert. This new approach reduces code duplication between enter and update. Rather than applying operators to both the enter and update selection separately, you can now apply them to the update selection after entering the nodes.

For example, say you had a selection of circles and wanted to update their radii. Previously you had to call the [attr](Selections#wiki-wiki-attr) operator twice, once for enter and once for update:

```javascript
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data([data]);
circle.exit().remove();
circle.enter().append("svg:circle").attr("r", radius); // for enter
circle.attr("r", radius); // for update
```

In addition, if you wanted *circle* to refer to all the on-screen nodes (enter âˆª update) subsequently, you'd have to reselect as well to merge the enter and update selections:

```javascript
circle = svg.selectAll("circle"); // reselect
```

In 2.0.0, you can eliminate this duplicate code because entering nodes will add them to *both* the enter selection and the update selection simultaneously. Running operators on the update selection after enter will thus apply to both entering and updating nodes:

```javascript
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data([data]);
circle.exit().remove();
circle.enter().append("svg:circle"); // adds enter to update
circle.attr("r", radius); // for enter and update
```

Note: in the rare case that you want to run operators only on the updating nodes, you can run them on the update selection before entering new nodes.

### Selector Functions

The [select](Selections#wiki-wiki-select) and [selectAll](Selections#wiki-wiki-selectAll) operators can now take **selector functions**, in addition to selector strings such as "#id" and ".class". For example, if you want to select the first child of every element, you can now say:

```javascript
var children = g.select(function() { return this.firstChild; });
```

This also means that selection can dynamically create new elements, or reorder existing elements by re-inserting them into the DOM. This is an advanced feature, but you might find it useful for extending D3. For example, you could use XPath rather than selectors if you wanted.

### Transparent Transitions

Transitions are now **transparent** arrays of elements, and you can inspect them in the developer console just like selections. Each selected element is wrapped in an object that stores the delay and duration of the associated transition. (Recall that these values are computed on a per-element basis for staggered animations.) Internally, some of the timing logic that manages transitions has also been simplified, improving performance and fixing a few timing bugs.

The [each](Transitions#wiki-wiki-each) operator can now be called with one argument (a callback function), offering compatibility with the selection's [each](Selections#wiki-wiki-each) operator. Transitions now expose an [id](Transitions#wiki-wiki-id) property, which can be useful for debugging concurrent transitions; this identifier is inherited by subtransitions, fixing a bug with nested transitions.

**Sequenced** transitions are now also easier to implement, thanks to the transition's [transition](Transitions#wiki-transition) operator, which returns a copy of the current transition. The copy inherits the delay, duration, id and easing of the original transition. You can then modify the delay to sequence multiple transitions, without needing to listen for the "end" event. For example, here's how you would enter a circle, and then remove it after a couple seconds:

```javascript
svg.append("svg:circle")
    .attr("r", 1e-6)
  .transition()
    .ease(Math.sqrt)
    .attr("r", 4.5)
  .transition()
    .delay(2000)
    .attr("r", 1e-6)
    .remove();
```

You can also use this technique to use different easing functions for different tweens! For example, you could use "cubic-in-out" easing for position properties, and "linear" for color.

### Custom Tweens

A new, generic [tween](Transitions#wiki-wiki-tween) operator has been added, which is used internally by the other tweens (`style`, `attr`, *etc.*). You can use this operator directly if you want to define a custom tween as part of the transition; use this instead of listening for a transition "tick" event. For example, the `text` operator does not interpolate by default, but you can now interpolate text content by saying:

```javascript
selection.transition().tween("text", function() {
  var i = d3.interpolate(this.textContent, "yellow");
  return function(t) {
    this.textContent = i(t);
  };
});
```

You might want to write your tweens as reusable functions (say, closures) rather than the above example which hard-codes the transition to "yellow". See the built-in attr and style tweens for inspiration.

### Axes

A new **axis** component has been added to the [d3.svg](SVG-Shapes) module. The axis component makes it easy to add reference lines, ticks and labels to any visualization. This display of the axes is highly customizable, and best of all, the axes support smooth transitions automatically. See this [quick demo](http://bl.ocks.org/1166403) of axes used by an area chart. More documentation and examples for this component will be coming in the next few days.

### Extending and Overriding

Selection and transition are now defined using [prototype injection](http://perfectionkills.com/how-ecmascript-5-still-does-not-allow-to-subclass-an-array/) rather than direct extension. This improves performance and reduces memory overhead, as the majority of methods are now defined on a prototype rather than on each instance. Also, this makes the code cleaner as each operator is fully separable and defined in its own source file. This fixed a few bugs, such as the missing [empty](Selections#wiki-wiki-empty) operator on enter selections.

Prototype injection also means that selections and transitions can be extended and customized! You can now override the behavior of D3's core operators, or add your own. This may be particularly useful to provide compatibility with nonstandard browsers, or proprietary document object models. You can also use JavaScript's `instanceof` operator to see whether an object is a `d3.selection` or `d3.transition`.

### Tests

D3 now has an extensive test suite built with [Vows](http://vowsjs.org). As of the 2.0.0 release, we have 1,200+ tests and 90% coverage of the core library. More tests are under development. The tests are written to verify the behavior of each of D3's operators, and may be interesting to explore if you have questions about how D3 works, complementing the API reference.
